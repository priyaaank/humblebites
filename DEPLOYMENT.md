#### 3. Upload Your Website

**Option A: Using Git Command Line (Recommended)**

Open Terminal/Command Prompt in your website folder and run:

```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

git add .

# Commit files
git commit -m "Initial commit: Humble Bites website"

```

```

(Replace `priyaaank` with your GitHub username and `hb` with your repository name)

### Updating Your Menu Daily

Every time you want to update your menu:

```bash
# 1. Edit menu-config.json with your text editor

# 2. Commit the changes
git add menu-config.json
git commit -m "Update menu for October 14, 2025"

# 3. Push to GitHub
git push
```

Your website will automatically update in 1-2 minutes!

### Quick Update Script

Create a file named `update-menu.sh` for quick updates:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Updating menu..."
git add menu-config.json
git commit -m "Update menu for $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
git push
echo "Menu updated! Changes will be live in 1-2 minutes."
```

Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x update-menu.sh
```

Then just run:
```bash
./update-menu.sh
```

Type: A

## Testing Before Deployment

Always test locally before deploying:

```bash
# Using Docker
docker-compose up

# Or using Python
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Visit `http://localhost:8080` to test.

## Troubleshooting Deployment

### Changes not showing up
- Wait 2-5 minutes for GitHub Pages to rebuild
- Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Clear browser cache

### 404 Page Not Found
- Ensure `index.html` is in the root directory
- Check that GitHub Pages is enabled
- Verify the correct branch is selected

### Menu not loading
- Check `menu-config.json` is valid JSON
- Open browser console (F12) to see errors
- Ensure file paths are correct (case-sensitive)

### Images not showing
- Verify image paths in `menu-config.json`
- Check that images are uploaded to GitHub
- Ensure file names match exactly (case-sensitive)

## Security Notes

### WhatsApp Number
- Your WhatsApp number will be visible in the source code
- This is normal for business websites
- Use a business WhatsApp number, not personal

### Menu Configuration
- Don't put sensitive information in `menu-config.json`
- It's publicly accessible
- Only include product information and pricing

## Backup

Always keep a backup:

```bash
# Clone your repository to another location
git clone https://github.com/priyaaank/hb.git hb-backup
```

Or simply download a ZIP from GitHub:
