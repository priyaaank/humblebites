                <h2>Early Beginnings</h2>
                <p>Isabella's culinary journey began in her grandmother's kitchen in Valencia, Spain, where she learned that the best dishes start with the freshest ingredients and are prepared with love. At age 8, she was already helping make paella for family gatherings, developing an intuitive understanding of how flavors work together.</p>
                
                <p>After moving to the United States with her family, Isabella discovered a passion for combining her Spanish heritage with American culinary traditions. This fusion became the foundation of her unique cooking style—respectful of tradition yet innovative in approach.</p>

            <div class="story-block">
                <h2>Professional Journey</h2>
                <p>Isabella earned her culinary degree from the Culinary Institute of America before working in some of the most prestigious kitchens on both coasts. She spent three years as sous chef at the acclaimed Chez Laurent in New York, followed by two years at the pioneering farm-to-table restaurant Harvest Moon in Sonoma County.</p>
                
                <p>Her defining moment came during a stage at elBulli in Spain, where she worked alongside Ferran Adrià and discovered her passion for molecular gastronomy techniques applied to traditional ingredients. This experience taught her that innovation should enhance, never overshadow, the natural beauty of exceptional ingredients.</p>

                <h2>Philosophy & Approach</h2>
                <p>"Cooking is about storytelling," Isabella often says. "Every dish should tell you something about where it came from, who grew it, and why we chose to prepare it this way." This philosophy drives every menu she creates, from the simplest appetizer to the most complex tasting menu.</p>
                
                <p>Isabella is passionate about sustainable cooking and works directly with local farmers to source ingredients at their peak. She believes in nose-to-tail cooking, minimizing waste, and creating dishes that are both environmentally conscious and deliciously satisfying.</p>
